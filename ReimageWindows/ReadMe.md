# Reimage Windows

I want a nice fresh copy of Windows every now and then.
Think of it like spring cleaning.

1. Get a 8GB or more USB FlashDrive and give it a quick format.
   Make sure to lable the volume.
2. Download the [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) and "ShowKeyPlus" [1][ref_1] from the Windows store.
3. Download the [Windows 11 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) directly from Microsoft.
4. Download the latest drivers and extract the drivers to the hard drive (`c:/working/drivers`).
   The raw `.inf` files must be present for this to work.
   ```{ps1}
   mkdir c:/working/drivers
   ```
6. Run ShowKeyPlus and record the "Installed Key".
7. Run Rufus to create a bootable Windows 11 recovery drive.
8. Create and download an `autounattend.xml` file [2][ref_2] or use the [cached file][file_1].
   * **DO NOT** copy in the Installed Key.
     It gets added in later.
   * In the "Scripts to run when the first user logs on after Windows has been installed" section, in the _first_ section, add the following as a `.ps1`.
     ```
     if('Unrestricted' -ne (Get-ExecutionPolicy)) { Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force }
     iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
     refreshenv

     choco install "7zip;adobereader;notepadplusplus;tailscale;paint.net" -y
     choco install "git;vscode;docker-desktop" -y
     choco install "aescrypt;filezilla;vlc" -y
     ```
9. Wait for Rufus to complete.
10. Copy `autounattend.xml` to the root of the USB FlashDrive.
11. Add in the "Installed Key" from step 5 to the `autounattend.xml` file on the USB FlashDrive.
    Search for `<Key>` quick replace.
    It should be close to the top of the file. 
12. Copy the `install.wim` file from the USB FlashDrive (`~/sources/install.wmi`) to the hard drive (`c:/working/wim/install.wim`).
    ```{ps1}
    mkdir c:\working\wim
    copy d:/sources/install.wmi c:/working/wim/install.wim
    ```
13. In an Admin Powershell, find the index of the version of windows that corsponds to the Installed Key's SKU.
    ```{ps1}
    Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath C:\working\wim\install.wim
    ```
14. In an Admin Powershell, mount, update, and recreate the `install.wim` file [3][ref_3].
    ```{ps1}
    mkdir c:\working\mount
    Mount-WindowsImage -Path c:\working\mount\ -ImagePath c:\working\wim\install.wim -Index 6
    Add-WindowsDriver -Path c:\working\mount\ -Driver c:\working\drivers -Recurse
    Dismount-WindowsImage -Path c:\working\mount\ â€“Save
    rmdir c:\working\mount
    ```
15. Copy the `boot.wim` file from the hard drive (`c:/working/wim/boot.wim`) to the USB FlashDrive (`~/sources/boot.wmi`).
    ```
    del d:/sources/install.wmi
    copy c:/working/wim/install.wim d:/sources/install.wmi
    ```
16. Restart the computer in recovery mode to allow USB boot.
    Start > System > Recovery > Advanced Startup > Restart Now
